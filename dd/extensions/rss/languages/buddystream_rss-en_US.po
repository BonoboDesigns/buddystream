"Using Rss filters will prevent overcrowded and \"messy\" activity streams."
"<br>Example: You may have a network what focuses on soccer. <br>To keep "
"things \"clean\" you will only want items that pertain to soccer to be "
"imported.<br>By adding the word \"soccer\" to the filter below, only items "
"with the word \"soccer\" will be imported and shown in the users activity "
"stream.<br><br>By using commas as a delimiter  you may set-up multiple "
"filters (No filter = all Rss items.)<br>In addition, the \"Explicit words\" "
"filter, will block any item that contains them regardless of the other "
"filter.<br><b>Note:</b> Keywords listed in the \"Good\" Filter must be "
"present in the update itself to be included in the site import. Likewise, "
"keywords listed in the \"Explicit Filter\" will cause that particular update "
"NOT to be imported."
